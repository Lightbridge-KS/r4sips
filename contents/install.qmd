## What is R

-   When people say **R**, they usually refer to the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

-   R usually not installed in your computer by default, you'll need to download it from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org) maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available for *free*.
  
-   When you have R installed, then you can write and run **R code** which is the human-readable text that instructs R interpreter what to do. 

## Download & Install R

1. Go to <https://cran.r-project.org>
   
2. Follow the links to download R for your operating systems.

### Mac

For **Mac users**, download the `.pkg` file from the latest release section.

### Windows

For **Windows users**, I recommend install both the [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version as well as [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

-   **Download [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version** as an `.exe` file which is an installation wizard. It will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that youâ€™ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.

-   **Download [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)** which is not R itself but a toolchain for making life easier when you need to install additional R package, so I recommend you to install it as well. Find the **Rtools installer** link to download an installation wizard then follows the instructions.
