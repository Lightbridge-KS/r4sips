# Install R & RStudio


## What is R

-   When people say **R**, they usually refer to the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

-   R usually not installed in your computer by default, you'll need to download it from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org) maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available for *free*.

-   When you have R installed, then you can write and run **R code** which is the human-readable text that instructs R interpreter (program that execute R code) what to do.

## Install R

1.  Go to <https://cran.r-project.org>

2.  Follow the links to download R for your operating systems.

### Mac

For **Mac users**, download the `.pkg` file from the latest release section.

![Download R for Mac](/images/setup/cran-dl-mac.png){#fig-dl-r-mac}

see @fig-dl-r-mac

### Windows

For **Windows users**, I recommend install both the [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version as well as [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

#### **Download [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)**

You'll get an installation wizard (`.exe`). Open them, it will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you'll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.

#### **Download [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**

`Rtools` is not R itself but a toolchain for making life easier when you need to install additional R package, so I recommend you to install it as well. Find the **Rtools installer** link to download an installation wizard (`.exe`) then follows the instructions.

## Using R Console

After you have R installed, it comes with **R console** application.

![](/images/setup/R-app-logo.png){fig-align="center" width="20%"}

Open the app, try type `1 + 1` after the prompt `>` and press `Enter` you should see `2`.

``` r
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```

R console app is an interactive command-line REPL (read-eval-print loop). You type R code in there, hit `Enter`, then the R interpreter will evaluate R code and print the result back. It's a simple and quick way to interact with R.

For me, I use R console as a calculator replacement, that's all.

To do anything serious with R, you'll need RStudio which I will cover these in the next section.

### Tips: R in CLI

For anyone who prefer using Command Line Interface or Terminall app (Mac) as an R console, open your terminal window and type the command:

``` bash
$ R
```

which opens an R REPL. You can then execute any R code in there. To exit, type `q()` to quit.

Moreover, I recommend you checkout [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) which is a *modern* R console that comes with multiline editing and rich syntax highlight. I prefer to use it as my main R console now.

## Install RStudio

RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) made for R user.

It is an application that contains several features and environment to help you write and run R code; perform any data science task involving R, create reproducible report, web application, blog, books, and much more.

RStudio is available in open source (free) and commercial (paid) editions.

> [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

The **RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition)** is enough for most real-world use. You'll not miss important feature in there, so I recommend you install that one. Just click the "Download RStudio" button and follow the simple instructions that follow.

If you want to use R and RStudio "on the web" you can try [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) which run in your web browser. However, if you can, I recommend you download and try to use the Desktop version in your computer as the contents of this book will be based on.

## Using RStudio


In your computer, open RStudio application.

![RStudio App](/images/setup/RStudio-app-logo.png){#fig-rstudio-app width="25%"}

You should see something like @fig-rstudio-panes

### Create New R Project

I recommend you create R project for each project you working on. Let's create one now for this tutorial. In the menu bar in upper left corner, click the **blue box button** with a letter R (the second button from the left).

![RStudio menu bar](/images/setup/rstudio-menu-bar.png){#fig-rstudio-menu-bar width="100%"}

Follows these steps:

1. Click **`New Directory`**: to start R project in a brand new folder

2. Click **`New Project`**: to create regular R project

3. Click **`Browse...`**: to choose a location where the project directory will lives in. 

4.  In **Directory name:** text field type your desired project name. I recommend you use project name with *no space*, instead use underscore `_` or dash `-` to separte words. 


![Create `learn-r` R project directory in my Desktop](/images/setup/create-proj.png){#fig-create-project width="100%"}

For the example @fig-create-project, I create `learn-r` project in the Desktop. You can use other name if you like, you can change it later. Click **Create Project** to finish.
