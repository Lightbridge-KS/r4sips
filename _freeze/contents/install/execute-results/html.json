Go to <https://cran.r-project.org>\n   \n2. Follow the links to download R for your operating systems.\n\n![R Download Links](/images/setup/cran-dl-r.png)\n\n### Mac\n\nFor **Mac users**, download the `.pkg` file from the latest release section.\n\n![Download R for Mac](/images/setup/cran-dl-mac.png)\n\n### Windows\n\nFor **Windows users**, I recommend install both the [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version as well as [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).\n\n\n![Download R for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win.png)\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### **Download [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)**\n\nYou'll get an installation wizard (`.exe`). Open them, it will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that you’ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n:::\n\n\n![Download `base` for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win-base.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### **Download [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**\n\n`Rtools` is not R itself but a toolchain for making life easier when you need to install additional R package, so I recommend you to install it as well. Find the **Rtools installer** link to download an installation wizard (`.exe`) then follows the instructions.\n:::\n\n\n![Example link to `Rtools42` installer for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win-rtools.png)\n\n\n## Using R Console\n\nAfter you have R installed, it comes with **R console** application. \n\n![](/images/setup/R-app-logo.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"20%\"}\n\nOpen the app, try type `1 + 1` after the prompt `>` and press `Enter` you should see `2`.\n\n```r\n> 1 + 1\n[1] 2\n```\n\nR console app is an interactive command-line REPL (read-eval-print loop). You type R code in there, hit `Enter`, then the R interpreter will evaluate R code and print the result back. It's a simple and quick way to interact with R.\n\nFor me, I use R console as a calculator replacement, that's all. \n\nTo do anything serious with R, you'll need RStudio which I will cover these in the next section.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### Tips: R in CLI\nFor anyone who prefer using Command Line Interface or Terminall app (Mac) as an R console, open your terminal window and type the command:\n\n```bash\n$ R\n```\n\nwhich opens an R REPL. You can then execute any R code in there. To exit, type `q()` to quit.\n\nMoreover, I recommend you checkout [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) which is a *modern* R console that comes with multiline editing and rich syntax highlight. I prefer it as my main R console now.\n:::\n\n\n## What is RStudio\n\nRStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) made for R user. \n\nIt is an application that contains several features and environment to help you write and run R code; perform any data science task involving R, create reproducible report, web application, blog, books, and much more.\n\n\n## Install RStudio\n\nRStudio is available in open source (free) and commercial (paid) editions. \n\n-   [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)\n\nThe **RStudio Desktop (Open Source Edition)** is enought for most real-world use. You'll not miss important feature in there, so I recommend you install that one. Just click the “Download RStudio” button and follow the simple instructions that follow.\n\n",
