Go to <https://cran.r-project.org>\n   \n2. Follow the links to download R for your operating systems.\n\n![R Download Links](/images/setup/cran-dl-r.png)\n\n### Mac\n\nFor **Mac users**, download the `.pkg` file from the latest release section.\n\n![Download R for Mac](/images/setup/cran-dl-mac.png)\n\n### Windows\n\nFor **Windows users**, I recommend install both the [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version as well as [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).\n\n\n![Download R for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win.png)\n\n\n-   **Download [`base`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) version** as an `.exe` file which is an installation wizard. It will install R into your program files folders and place a shortcut in your Start menu. Note that youâ€™ll need to have all of the appropriate administration privileges to install new software on your machine.\n\n![Download `base` for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win-base.png)\n\n\n-   **Download [`Rtools`](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)** which is not R itself but a toolchain for making life easier when you need to install additional R package, so I recommend you to install it as well. Find the **Rtools installer** link to download an installation wizard then follows the instructions.\n\n![Example link to `Rtools42` installer for Windows](/images/setup/cran-dl-win-rtools.png)\n\n\n## What is RStudio\n\n\n\n## Install RStudio\n",
